###BotWatch

This Android app allows the standard models of Lego Mindstorms NXT to be remote controlled by Bluetooth.

While there are plenty of other apps I wanted it to keep it simple for my five-year-old. Main objectives were having everything on one screen, pretty buttons and not having to scan / acknowledge on every startup.

Robot can be made move forward, backward and turn in any direction in one of four pre-set speeds. Light can be turned on in any color and action motor rotated.

Additionaly two programs on the NXT can be started by Buttons.

###Notes 

You need to pair the NXT in the bluetooth section of the system settings in order to pick them from the list. Otherwise you can still enter the MAC address manually.

When entering the custom program names don't forget to add the file extension.

###Credits

I studied the [MINDROID Project](https://github.com/NXT/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-MINDdroid) to learn and used their LCPMessage class for generating commands.
